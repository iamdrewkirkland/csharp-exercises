# Vending Machine

## A C# LINQ Exercise

The console application in the exercise represents an interactive vending machine. Users can view and search products, purchase products and add new products.

Your job is to implement the methods and properties found in the Vending Machine class to make the console application function properly. Use the context clues in the menu, the code in `Program.cs`, comments in the `VendingMachine` class, as well as you own judgment to determine what each method should do.
